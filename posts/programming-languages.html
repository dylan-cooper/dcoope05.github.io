<h1>Programming Languages</h1>

<p>
  This is a (somewhat) brief overview of the programming languages and
  technologies that I have used.  I will try to keep it up to date as much as
  possible.
</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript is the language of the web, and has consequently become my primary
  programming language.  I am comfortable working with vanilla JavaScript when
  there is a need, but also familiar with many languages, frameworks and
  technologies surrounding the language including:
  <ul>
    <li>JQuery</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>npm</li>
    <li>electron</li>
    <li>knockout</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Redux</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>webgl</li>
    <li>Sencha Ext JS</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h2>C</h2>
<p>
  C is the primary language used in University of Guelph computing courses.  I
  have a thorough understanding of the ins and outs of the language.  I've used
  it for multiple programs including a maze solver, binary search tree,
  lexer/parser and sudoku puzzle solver.
</p>

<h2>C# and .NET MVC</h2>
<p>
  I used the C# programming language with the .NET MVC framework during my first
  co-op term at the University of Guelph.  I became very familiar with the
  framework and language, as part of my job was introducing it to other members
  of the team who would be working on the system in the future.
</p>

<h2>Java</h2>
<p>
  My experience in Java is limited to classes in object oriented design at the
  University of Guelph.  The most common use case for Java in these courses was
  Swing-based GUI programs, so I have used it to make a few of those.  It is
  also my language of choice for programming contests and Project Euler
  questions.
</p>

<h2>QBASIC</h2>
<p>
  QBASIC was the first programming language I learned, in high school.  As this
  was when I was just learning the basics of programming, the programs that I
  wrote were pretty "basic".  I leave it on this list because this is really
  where I fell in love with programming.  Below is some old code I found from an
  exercise which was before the concept of nested loops was introduced. &#x1F642;
</p>
<pre class="code" title="Note on line 110, I think the semicolon is used to avoid printing a newline.">
1 ' Description : Prints lines of Stars
2 ' Programmer : Dylan Cooper
3 ' Date : Feb 17

4 ' Variables
5 '     I - controls the loop
6 '     NUMSTARS - number of lines of stars
7 '     STARCOUNT - number of stars already on that line

50 CLS
70 PRINT "How many lines of stars would you like?";
80 INPUT NUMSTARS
90 FOR I = 1 TO NUMSTARS
100     LET STARCOUNT = STARCOUNT + 1
110     IF STARCOUNT < I THEN PRINT "*";  ELSE PRINT "*"
120     IF STARCOUNT < I THEN GOTO 100
130     LET STARCOUNT = 0
140 NEXT I
</pre>

<h2>Visual Basic 6</h2>
<p>
  After learning the basics in QBASIC, our high school programming courses moved
  on to teach the wonders of Visual Basic 6, where we created GUIs and games.
  During this time, I created a Deal or No Deal game, a pool/billiards game, a
  pacman-esque game and a mario-esque game.  I found the old source code
  recently, and may post a picture of what the games looked like if I can find
  a way to compile it. &#x1F606;
</p>

<h2>PHP</h2>
<p>
  I've used PHP for a few projects and am pretty comfortable using it for just
  about anything.  As part of a 2 day hack-a-thon during my work term at
  FreshBooks, I used it to write the backend for their "business name generator"
  and it later became a constant companion when I started at Tulip Retail where
  it's their systems' primary language.
</p>

<h2>Python</h2>
<p>
  Python is a pretty nice language with some cool features.  I've used it
  for a couple of projects including a graphing calculator for a group project
  in a software design class. You can see the source code
  <a href="https://github.com/dylan-cooper/Graphing-Calculator">here</a>.  I've
  also used it for a lot of small scripts, and it's the language that I use
  most frequently when I need to do some mathematical calculations.
