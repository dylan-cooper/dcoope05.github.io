<h1>Co-op with Tulip Retail</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  In the Summer of 2017, I worked as a full-stack developer at Tulip Retail, a
  software company that builds retail and ecommerce software.
</p>

<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>
  This was my second co-op term with Tulip Retail.  For this term, I moved to
  commerce engine platform team.  Our team was responsible for maintenance and
  upgrades to the core back-end platform used across all of the Tulip's products.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<h3>Improve Back-End Development Skills</h3>

<p>
  Most of my time over this four-month term was spent on working on the back-end
  systems for Tulip's core platform.  I learned a lot about how to build scalable
  back-end systems and about the technologies that can be used to build these
  systems.  Some of the technologies that were new to me included:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Docker</li>
  <li>Solr</li>
  <li>Beanstalk</li>
  <li>Codeception</li>
</ul>

<p>
  On top of these technologies, I learned a lot about how to architect and structure
  large software systems.
</p>

<h3>Improve Project Management Skills</h3>

<p>
  Over the course of the work term, I gained an increasing amount of autonomy
  to manage and work on projects independently.  I would typically spend
  between 2 and 4 weeks on each project, determining what needs to be done,
  how to do it, and ultimately implementing the project.  By working with this
  autonomy and managing my own tasks, my project and time management skills
  grew.
</p>

<h3>Successfully Deliver Projects and Features</h3>

<p>
  The most important part of any job is to get work done and to be an asset to the
  company.  This was my main focus for the work term, delivering high quality
  software on time and on spec.  In this respect, the term was a success; I was
  able to work with my team and across teams to deliver the necessary software
  to ship new features and to enable our clients.  Over the course of four months,
  I was able add many new features to the core product, on top of working on some
  larger projects including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Upgrading the back-end from PHP 5.3 to PHP 7.</li>
  <li>Creating a new API documentation framework and engine.</li>
  <li>Refactoring and redesigning a core API.</li>
  <li>Using a new framework to build a test suite for a core project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>
  While at Tulip, I worked with a lot of really great people.  The sense of
  community at Tulip was very strong and their simple "no jerks" policy worked
  really well to build a team of awesome people.  A special thank you goes to
  the members of the platform team, who I worked with most closely; Shaghayegh,
  Phil and Chris were a very big part of what made this co-op term a success.
