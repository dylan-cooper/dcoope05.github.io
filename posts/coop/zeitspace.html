<h1>Co-op with Zeitspace</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  During the winter of 2017, I worked as a software developer for 4
  months at Zeitspace, a brand new software design and development agency.
</p>

<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>
  My first day of work, I arrived to an office with two desks and two
  chairs.  I knew right away that this would be a very different job
  than I was used to.   I was the first employee of this new venture started
  by Waterloo UX Design guru Mark Connolly and I was eager to face the
  challenges that would come with the new environment.
</p>

<p>
  For the first half of the work term, I was the only developer working for the
  company, and then in the second half, our development team doubled in size
  when the company's first full-time developer, Fabio joined.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<h3>Gain experience with iOS and mobile development</h3>

<p>
  The first project that Zeitspace took part in was an iOS application for
  helping parents of campers and campground administrators communicate.  It
  was my first time delving into the world of iOS and mobile application
  development, coming from a web application background.  I learned to use
  the Swift programming language and about the architectural decisions that
  go into making an iOS application.  I was able to learn the lay of the land
  quickly and ultimately built the application with few hiccups.  It was great
  for me to learn about this new side of programming, and while it isn't the
  area where I intend to specialize, I appreciate that I was provided the
  opportunity to test the waters.
</p>

<h3>Improve focus on particular features during development</h3>

<p>
  Early in the term, I would frequently get into a bad habit of jumping all
  over the place when adding new code/features.  This is a habit that is easy to
  get into when working as the sole contributor to the project, but I knew that
  it was getting in the way of having fully completed features, and as a result,
  of being able to easily estimate the progress of the project.  When I noticed
  this, I wrote it down as one of my goals and worked hard to focus on completely
  finishing one feature before moving on to the next.  I did improve in this regard,
  though the problem was also alleviated when working in a larger team where plans
  and coordination are more explicit.  I expect the progress that I made here will
  help me when working on schoolwork and personal projects where I am working
  independently rather than in a team.
</p>

<h3>Work directly with clients</h3>

<p>
  One of the most interesting parts for me about working in an agency rather than
  a large development organization was that I was able to spend a lot more time
  working with clients, assessing their needs and how to go about meeting them.
  Over the course of this work term, I spent a lot of time emailing, and chatting
  with the company's clients to get a read on what they want.  Plus, I would do
  weekly demos to show the progress the team was making.  I really enjoyed this
  aspect of the job and it gave me new insights into what it means to help clients
  get what they want and how the software development lifecycle works.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  My primary goal with each of my work terms is to gain a better understanding
  of different areas in the software development/tech industry.  This work term
  gave me a lot insight into two environments that I hadn't previously explored.
</p>

<p>
  First, working in a very small, very new company.  Zeitspace was a very early
  stage company, and I learned a lot about how new companies work and how to get
  them off the ground from Mark.  I hope to one day be a part of a venture of my own,
  building a company from the ground up and the lessons I learned here will be
  very valuable in this regard.
</p>

<p>
  Second, working in an agency/dev shop.  Prior to this, I had only worked in product
  teams within product companies, where the goal was to build and maintain large 
  systems and applications.  Working in an agency, with smaller projects and jumping
  between different, unrelated clients was a very new experience for me.  Learning
  about this different work environment will help me in the future when I am looking
  for long-term, full-time work.
</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>
  Mark and Fabio, the members of the Zeitspace team that I worked with most closely
  were a big part of what made this work term a success.  Working with the two of
  you was a pleasure.
