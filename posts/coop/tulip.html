<h1>Co-op with Tulip Retail</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img class="small left" src="img/tulip.png"></img>
<p>
  In the Summer of 2016, I worked as a software developer at Tulip Retail, a
  software company that builds retail and ecommerce software.
</p>

<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>
  For most of my work term, I worked as a member of the "Well" team doing
  maintenance work for ecommerce website <a href="https://well.ca">well.ca</a>.
  I was doing full stack web development using PHP and the LAMP stack.  The
  first two months of the work term, I was doing "regular" work for the well
  team, working on bug fixes and adding minor features to the platform.  Near
  the beginning of July I was given a larger project, adding the VISA Checkout
  payment gateway to the website.  This took about a month, which led me back to
  the regular tickets plus documentation for the remainder of my work term.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<h3>Technical Skills and the LAMP stack</h3>

<p>
  This position was my first time working as a full stack developer using the
  LAMP (linux, apache, mysql, php) stack.  On top of this, we used technologies
  such as memcache, solr, vagrant and ext.js which were all new to me.  PHP
  became my prima lingua for these 4 months and I learned a lot of the ins and
  outs of the language.  By the end of the work term, I was very comfortable
  working within the company's codebase and was able to document and explain how
  areas of the codebase which hadn't been touched in a while work.
</p>

<h3>Host a Tech Talk</h3>

<p>
  During the last month of my work term, Tulip organized a Hack Day where we
  worked on projects outside of our regular tasks for one day and then presented
  them to each other at the end of the day.  For my project, I did a deep dive
  into GraphQL, an open source project created at Facebook as an alternative for
  REST APIs.  I made a proof of concept in node.js with a few of the main models
  from our platform.  There was enough interest that the next week I also did a
  half hour tech talk about GraphQL and its merits over RESTful APIs.  This was
  a really cool opportunity to explore a technology that interested me and also
  to show it to and start a discussion with the great people at Tulip.
</p>

<h3>Launch the VISA Checkout Project</h3>

<p>
  Two months into my work term, my supervisor asked me to work on a large
  project for well.ca which would ultimately take over most of my remaining time
  at the company.  VISA Checkout is a new payment gateway similar to PayPal
  provided by VISA that can give a simple, unified user experience across
  multiple online stores.  I gained a lot of insight into how to integrate third
  party platforms through this project.  I also gained experience interacting
  with external stakeholders and negotiating features to make sure that the
  project met everyone's expectations and was completed on time.  This was a
  great experience for me because it allowed me to work on a large project with
  a lot of independence.  The project was a success and was launched without any
  upsets.
</p>

<h3>Improve Time Management Skills</h3>

<p>
  About a month into this work term, I decided that I would make it my goal to
  improve my velocity and time management skills over the course of the rest of
  the term.  In order to improve these skills, I started to use a Pomodoro timer
  which breaks down how much time you spend on a task and keeps you focused on
  the task at hand.  So, I would sit down and work on something for 25 minutes
  without pause for distraction, and then take 5 minute break and walk around a
  little bit before starting again.  I used this method whenever I was on a
  crunch to get something done and it was pretty effective.  I still have work
  to do to improve my time management skills, but I could tell that my
  productivity improved quite a bit over the course of the work term.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  My primary goal with each of my work terms is to gain a better understanding
  of different areas in the software development/tech industry.
</p>

<p>
  This work term gave me a lot of context of what it's like to work in the
  software industry.  Tulip is a high velocity software shop and this was my
  first time working as a developer in this sort of environment.  I came across
  a lot of things at Tulip that worked really well for me.  The development
  processes used at Tulip were very effective, they employed some aspects of
  agile development, but didn't force the point which led to processes that
  worked really well for their specific needs.  I really enjoyed this work term
  and would highly recommend working there to people with a "getting things
  done" attitude.

<p>
  While at Tulip, I worked with a lot of really great people.  The sense of
  community at Tulip was very strong and their simple "no jerks" policy worked
  really well to build a team of awesome people.  My coworkers in Kitchener who
  were supportive and helpful are a big part of why this work term was a
  success.  A special thank you goes out to my supervisor Amir for everything he
  did to help me during my time at Tulip.
