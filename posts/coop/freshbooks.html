<h1>Co-op with FreshBooks</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img id="fb-logo" src="img/freshbooks-logo.png">
<p>In the Fall of 2015, I worked as a Quality Assurance Analyst at FreshBooks, a tech company in Toronto focused on providing cloud accounting to service-based small businesses.  In addition to learning about quality assurance and testing software, I learned a lot about how modern software development in large teams works.</p>

<p>FreshBooks was very, very different from the University where I was working prior to this.  </p>

<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>As a member of the QA team, I got to experience many different parts of the company's software and poke around.  The manual testing portion of the job boiled down to taking changes that developers had recently been working on and examining it for any potential imperfections.  The automated testing part of the position is where I focused more, this included writing new tests for new changes, maintaining existing tests and refactoring.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<h3>Improve my ability to efficiently test software</h3>

<p>This was my first role as a software tester, and I got to spend a lot of time looking for ways to break software.  While I don't think that I will pursue software testing as a career in the future, the techniques I learned about how to look for bugs and how testers think will be very useful for me in the future.  By the end of my term I was able to test tickets that would come through much more quickly; I knew where to look for potential issues and what tests were most likely to find issues.  My work here was mostly testing front-end web development, and this is the area where my testing abilities most improved.</p>

<h3>Improve my understanding of agile software development</h3>

<p>At my previous position at CCS, we used a waterfall development process, whereas FreshBooks employed an agile mentality, always shipping.  Working on an agile team was very interesting, and there were definitely aspects of it that I liked more than the waterfall process.  Seeing changes that were made earlier in the week (or even day) live for the world to see was definitely pretty cool.</p>

<h3>Write thorough automated tests confidently</h3>

<p>While working at FreshBooks, I worked a lot with the automated testing suites, both writing new tests and maintaining the current tests when changes were made.  The automated testing tools that were being used included Cucumber, Capybara, Selenium and Poltergeist.  I became very familiar with how to use these to create concise tests with strong coverage.  Once my interest and aptitude for writing these tests became recognized, I became a go-to person whenever there were issues writing tests across several teams.  In my last month, I was given many tasks that amounted to fixing long-time bugs and improving/optimizing tests that took a very long time.</p>

<h3>Understand the FreshBooks architecture</h3>

<p>The FreshBooks software ecosystem was a lot more complex than anything that I had seen in the past.  There was a large network of distributed systems, a wide array of concurrent projects and *****.  Software architecture is one of my key interests and this was one of my first opportunities to see how a system this large could work together to accomplish complex tasks.  FreshBooks was using a large collection of technologies for assorted purposes and it was my goal that I was at least partially familiar with all of the main building blocks of the product.  I learned about quite a few cloud technologies and how they all fit together to create the FreshBooks service.</p>

<h3>Learn about the different roles in the tech industry</h3>

<p>Working at FreshBooks was my first experience with cross-functional teams.  In my previous position, the team was made entirely of developers who would gather requirements, design a solution and implement it.  Before shipping, the project as a whole would be handed off to a seperate team for testing.  The members of my direct team at FreshBooks on the other hand contained developers, testers, web designers, product owners, product managers and scrum masters (in addition to illustrators, copywriters, data analysts and more who weren't directly on my team).  This was like a new world to me; most developers weren't involved in the requirements gathering or design processes, and there were completely separate people designing the interface from implementing it.  </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>My goal with each of my work terms is to gain a better understanding of different areas in the software development/tech industry.</p>

<p>There were a lot of aspects to this job that I really liked.  The team was small, so I never felt like a "cog in the machine"; I could see how my work was impacting the product as a whole, and how the documentation that I was contributing to the team's knowledge-base would affect the future of the project. I really liked the stage that the project was at (pre-production) because I got to help set up software and processes in a way that I wouldn't get if I came in after the project was further along in the process. Another thing that I liked about this position was that there was always more work to do and I was very rarely waiting around for more work. It was interesting to work for the University because the organization was very service-oriented (the underlying goal of CCS is to make tasks easier for employees and students rather than to sell products or grow revenue).</p>
