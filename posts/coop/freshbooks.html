<h1>Co-op with FreshBooks</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img class="medium left" src="img/freshbooks-logo.png">
<p>In the Fall of 2015, I worked as a Quality Assurance Analyst at FreshBooks, a tech company in Toronto focused on providing cloud accounting to service-based small businesses.  In addition to learning about quality assurance and testing software, I learned a lot about how modern software development in large teams works.</p>

<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>As a member of the QA team, I got to go into many different parts of the company's software and poke around.  The manual testing portion of the job boiled down to examining changes that developers had recently been working on and looking for potential bugs or imperfections.  The automated testing portion of the position is where I focused more, this included writing new tests for new changes, maintaining existing tests and refactoring the test suite.</p>
<p>I got to see a lot of different parts of the FreshBooks organization during my four month term.  My onboarding was with one of the teams that developed and maintained the core functionality of the product.  After this, I spent about two months on the public website team.  The focus on this team was on search engine optimization and increasing conversions, two concepts that were very new to me.  My final six weeks were spent on one of the teams focused on online payments.  I learned a lot on this team about the different parts of processing payments online and how to integrate third parties into an app.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>About a month into the work term, I wrote down 5 goals for the semester:</p>

<h3>Improve my ability to efficiently test software</h3>

<p>This was my first role as a software tester, and I got to spend a lot of time looking for ways to break software.  While I don't think that I will pursue software testing as a career in the future, the techniques I learned for looking for bugs and the knowledge of how testers think will be very useful for me in the future.  By the end of my term I was able to test tickets that would come through much more quickly; I knew where to look for potential issues and what tests were most likely to find issues.  The testing I did here was mostly testing front-end web development, and this is the area where my abilities improved most.</p>

<h3>Improve my understanding of agile software development</h3>

<p>At my previous position at CCS, we used a waterfall development process, whereas FreshBooks was agile with a ship-first mentality.  Working on an agile team was very interesting, and there were definitely aspects of it that I liked more than the waterfall process.  Seeing changes that were made earlier in the week (or even day) live for the world to see was very encouraging.</p>
<p>Because I moved around between multiple teams during my work term, I was able to experience two different flavours of agile project management.  On the public website team, we used kanban agile while on the other teams we used scrum agile.  Being able to work in both systems gave me a lot of context that I hope will come in handy in the future.</p>

<h3>Write thorough automated tests confidently</h3>

<p>While working at FreshBooks, I worked a lot with the automated testing suites, both writing new tests and maintaining the current tests when changes were made.  The automated testing tools that were being used included Cucumber, Capybara, Selenium and Poltergeist.  I became very familiar with how to use these to create concise tests with strong coverage.  Once my interest and aptitude for writing these tests became recognized, I became a go-to person whenever there were issues writing tests across several teams.  In my last month, I was given many tasks that amounted to fixing long-time bugs and improving/optimizing tests that were exceptionally slow.</p>

<h3>Understand the FreshBooks architecture</h3>

<p>The FreshBooks software ecosystem was a lot more complex than anything that I had seen in the past.  There was a large network of distributed systems, a wide array of concurrent projects and dozens of developers working simultaneously.  Software architecture is one of my key interests and this was one of my first opportunities to see how a system this large could work together to accomplish complex tasks.  FreshBooks was using a large collection of technologies for assorted purposes and it was my goal to be at least partially familiar with all of the main building blocks of the system.  I was mostly successful in this goal and came out of this work term with a new understanding of many components needed to create a cloud-based product.</p>

<h3>Learn about the different roles in the tech industry</h3>

<p>Working at FreshBooks was my first experience with cross-functional teams.  In my previous position, the team was made entirely of developers who would gather requirements, design a solution and implement it.  Before shipping, the project as a whole would be handed off to a seperate team for testing.  The members of my direct team at FreshBooks on the other hand contained developers, testers, web designers, product owners, product managers and scrum masters (in addition to illustrators, copywriters, data analysts and more who weren't directly on my team).  This was like a new world to me; most developers weren't involved in the requirements gathering or design processes, and there were completely separate people designing the interface from implementing it.  I grew to appreciate this method, it kept people focusing on what they were most skilled in and reduced context switches.  </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>My primary goal with each of my work terms is to gain a better understanding of different areas in the software development/tech industry.</p>

<p>This work term provided me with a lot of new context of what is like to work in the tech industry.  I was able to see and participate in a lot of processes used in modern software development firsthand.  Among them were: agile software development, github pull requests, code reviews, peer programming, continuous integration and cross-discipline teams.  While I ultimately won't be pursuing a career in software testing, having the opportunity to try it firsthand gave me both an appreciation for the role and an assurance that this isn't where my passions lie.  My co-workers at FreshBooks were very intelligent and willing to teach, which led to me learning a lot about all sorts of topics both related to and not related to work.  FreshBooks has a great reputation among software companies in Toronto and it was a privilege to work there.</p>
