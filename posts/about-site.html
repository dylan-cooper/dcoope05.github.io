<h1>This site</h1>
<p>
  This site was designed as a simple, frameworkless, single page application.
</p>
<p>It is hosted through Github Pages.</p>
<p>
  Inspiration for the hashchanging technique on this site came from
  <a href="http://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/single-page-app-without-a-framework/">here</a>
  which allows the URL to dictate the state of the page even though it is an SPA.
</p>
<p>This site isn't responsive yet, but will be soon.</p>
