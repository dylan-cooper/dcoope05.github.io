<h1>This site</h1>
<p>This site was designed as a simple, frameworkless, single page application.  The reason I used an SPA rather than a more traditional application was because I felt like experimenting on a smaller scale (this) before I began a larger SPA project.</p>
<p>It is hosted through Github Pages.</p>
<p>
    Inspiration for the hashchanging technique on this site came from
    <a href="http://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/single-page-app-without-a-framework/">here</a>
    which allows the URL to dictate the state of the page even though it is an SPA.
</p>
<p>This site isn't responsive yet, but will be soon.</p>

<p>My career is still young, so this website is very small also.  I hope to expand it as I do more interesting things worth mentioning.</p>
