<h1>This site</h1>
<p>
  This site was designed as a simple, frameworkless, single page application.
</p>
<p>
  It is hosted through Github Pages and the source code can be found
  <a href="https://github.com/dylan-cooper/dylan-cooper.github.io">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Inspiration for the hashchanging technique on this site came from
  <a href="http://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/single-page-app-without-a-framework/">here</a>
  which allows the URL to dictate the state of the page even though it is an SPA.
