<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>
  This is an incomplete list of the different projects that I've spent time
  working on, with an emphasis on the ones that I think are more interesting.
</p>

<h2>VISA Checkout - Well.ca</h2>
<p>
  While employed at Tulip Retail in the summer of 2016, I was the primary
  developer working on adding the VISA Checkout payment gateway to ecommerce
  site Well.ca.  This project was very interesting and involved multiple third
  party stakeholders and vendors.  I was actively involved in taking this
  project through planning, design, implementation and ultimately launching it.
</p>

<h2>Goose</h2>
<p>
  One of my personal side projects during 2016 involved investigating webgl.  I
  spent a couple weeks going through tutorials and sample apps, and eventually
  decided to make my own small library which would let me build simple 2D webgl
  programs which would run in the browser.
</p>
<p>
  The library lets you write simple JS code to control objects' shape, speed,
  location, and movement.  I wrote two apps that go with it and are hosted on
  this site: <a href="#/snippets/goose-playground">a "playground" app</a> and
  <a href="#/snippets/goose-wordart">a word art app</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I really liked what I learned from this project and I'm hoping to block off a
  chunk of time in the near future to work on another webgl project.

<h2>Business Name Generator - FreshBooks</h2>
<p>
  As part of a hackday while I was working as a QA analyst at FreshBooks, a
  friend (named Nikin) and I built a simple business name generator webpage that
  was later launched to production as a marketing campaign.  It was a fun
  project which we used to explore a little bit of css animation too.  If you're
  interested, you can check it out
