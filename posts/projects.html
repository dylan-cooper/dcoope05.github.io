<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>
  This is an incomplete list of the different projects that I've spent time
  working on, with an emphasis on the ones that I think are more interesting.

<h2>Pool Game (Visual Basic 6)</h2>
<p>
  In high school as part of my grade 11 introduction to programming class, I
  wrote a pool game.  This game was my first experience with programming, took
  about a month to complete and inspired me to pursue computer science in
  University.

<h2>Maze Solver (C)</h2>
<p>
  I wrote a maze solver as part of the Data Structures course at the University
  of Guelph.  It's a stack-based solution and pretty simple to understand, it
  was my true introduction to writing modular, ADT-based C code.
