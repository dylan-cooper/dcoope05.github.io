<p>
  My name is Dylan Cooper, I recently finished my third year as an undergraduate
  student at the University of Guelph studying Computer Science (major) and 
  Physics (minor).
</p>
<p>
  I always had a passion for mathematics and when I was introduced to computer
  programming for the first time, I was hooked.
