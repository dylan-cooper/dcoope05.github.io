        <h1>This site</h1>
        <p>This site was designed as a simple, frameworkless, single page application.</p>
        <p>It is hosted through Github Pages.</p>
        <p>
            Inspiration for the hashchanging technique on this site came from
            <a href="http://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/single-page-app-without-a-framework/">here</a>
            which allows the URL to dictate the state of the page.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe I'll even make this page responsive...</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            My first co-op position came close to home, right here at the University of Guelph.  I worked in the Enterprise Applications department with a new system that was still being explored during my time with the team.  I worked heavily in C# using the .NET MVC framework as well as Knockout.JS which we used on the front-end.  This was my first experience with real-world software development and I experienced a lot:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requirements gathering with our clients</li>
            <li>Learning and teaching a new language and framework or two</li>
            <li>Exploring new technologies and sharing them with peers</li>
            <li>Writing two lines of documentation for every line of code</li>
        </ul>
